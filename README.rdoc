Pollster
========

Pollster is a basic Rails polling app. It enables a user to:
* create a poll
* create a custom public facing link for a poll, for instance if you wanted to create a poll about users' citrus fruit preferences, you might give it a custom link of 'citrus'
* add questions to a poll
* view users' responses to a poll
* view the public facing version of a poll
